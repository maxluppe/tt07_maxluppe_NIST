## How it works

This project implements in hardware the FMT and FBT from NIST statistical suite test based on L. B. Carreira, P. Danielson, A. A. Rahimi, M. Luppe and S. Gupta, "Low-Latency Reconfigurable Entropy Digital True Random Number Generator With Bias Detection and Correction," in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers, vol. 67, no. 5, pp. 1562-1575, May 2020, doi: 10.1109/TCSI.2019.2960694. and V. B. Suresh, D. Antonioli and W. P. Burleson, "On-chip lightweight implementation of reduced NIST randomness test suite," 2013 IEEE International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST), Austin, TX, USA, 2013, pp. 93-98, doi: 10.1109/HST.2013.6581572.

## How it works

This project implements a LFSR where the D-type FFs (DFFs) are replaceded by configurable delay lines.

The configurable delay lines are implement using multiplexers and buffers. The buffers generate a delay line path and the multiplexer select differents paths according to its selection control signals. The selection control signals are generated by a conventional LFSR.

It's expected that this circuit act as either as a convencional LFSR, or as an oscillator, or as a chaotic oscilator, according to the path generated by each delay line.

To verify its functionality, four statistical tests from the NIST statistical suite are also implemented:
1. The Frequency (Monobit) Test
2. Frequency Test within a Block
3. The Runs Test
4. Tests for the Longest-Run-of-Ones in a Block

They are choosen because they require at least 100 bits sequence to test.

The implementations are based on the following works:
